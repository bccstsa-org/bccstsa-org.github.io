We are the Vancouver British Columbia Canada SEPAK TAKRAW Association we love our unique sport we play every weekend. Our mission is to promote the sport here in Bc and all over Canada . People that are interested to learn and play the sport we are open on teaching basic skills on how to play.

```yaml
image:
  background: filename.png
```

This little bit of YAML makes the assumption that your background image asset is in the `/images` folder. If you place it somewhere else or are hotlinking from the web, just include the full http(s):// URL. Either way you should have a background image that is tiled.

If you want to set a background image for the entire site just add `background: filename.png` to your `_config.yml` and BOOM --- background images on every page!
